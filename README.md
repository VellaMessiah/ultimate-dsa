## ðŸ—º High-Level Preparation Roadmap
Topics are grouped into **independent blocks**, but the blocks themselves should be tackled **in order** for maximum efficiency:

**Block 1** â€” Math, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues  
**Block 2** â€” Searching, Sorting, Hashing  
**Block 3** â€” Strings  
**Block 4** â€” Trees, Graphs  
**Block 5** â€” Greedy, Dynamic Programming

## âœ… Block-Wise Checklist (with Gist!)
A block-by-block list of problems with:
- **Links** to solve them directly.
- **Gist summaries** for lightning-fast revision â€” perfect for that final 1â€“2 day sprint before an interview.  
Decide whether to code them again based on your confidence and remaining time.
