### ðŸ—º High-Level Preparation Roadmap
Topics are grouped into **independent blocks**, but the blocks themselves should be tackled **in order** for maximum efficiency:

**Block 1** â€” Math, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues  
**Block 2** â€” Searching, Sorting, Hashing  
**Block 3** â€” Strings  
**Block 4** â€” Trees, Graphs  
**Block 5** â€” Design ( Combines all the above - especially important for Google)  
**Block 6** â€” Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Design

### âœ… Block-Wise Checklist (with Gist!)
A block-by-block list of problems with:
- **Links** to solve them directly.
- **Gist summaries** for lightning-fast revision â€” perfect for that final 1â€“2 day sprint before an interview.  
Decide whether to code them again based on your confidence and remaining time.

#### Block 1 Math, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues 

**Linked Lists**
 - Rearrangement is the name of the game here. Questions like reverse a linked lists ( constant memory), k-reverse linked lists, merge sort on linked lists - all require a mastery over the concept of rearrangement. I have attached images for Linked lists in particular to help visualize the re-arrangement so that you can memorize the concept instead of the code.
 - I cannot emphasise this enough. ALWAYS CREATE A DUMMY HEAD of the linked lists. Return Dummy head -> next if you have to but it is always easier to create a dummy head ( In the beginning just make this a practise and soon while solving some of the more advanced problems like LRU cache, you will see why I emphasised this)
 - Linked List questions can often benefit from having two pointers move at different speeds ( How about mid-point of a linked list? Cycle Detection?)
 - Linked List cyclicity is the other most important concept - hence I will clearly explain the algorithm and why it works? Learn the why part carefully - good companies with smart people and a good culture will ask this instead of asking fancy super-hard rated problems
 - The whole purpose of Linked lists is dynamic allocation to save memory so always practice every question in an O(1) space way - even if it means sacrificing Performance ( within reason)

_Reversing a Linked List: TITH Algorithm_
Assume first node is the dummy head. We are trying to do this visually:
<img width="2198" height="1256" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c52ac58-6485-4286-a24e-bd8f3537aa95" />
The algorithm roughly looks like:

After you understand why this works - for speed, you can memorize this algorithm

```
        ListNode* itr = dummyHead->next;
        ListNode* temp = NULL;
        while(itr && itr->next){
            temp = itr->next; // T
            itr->next = temp->next; // I
            temp->next = dummyHead->next; // T
            dummyHead->next = temp; // H
        }

        return dummyHead->next;
```
We can reverse the same algorithm to reverse a sublist! just perform the step in the loop n = size of sublist times!

_Linked List Cyclicity: Algorith and why it works_
The algo maintains two pointers. One moves twice the speed of other - if there is a cycle in the linked list, both will eventually enter the cycle and in the cycle, the faster pointer will catch up to it. If it does, we know for sure that there is a cycle. This is purely logical.

![floyd_cycle_finding](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfc663e3-f843-41c4-8ed9-345755a930cf)

Finding the start of the cycle is where the algorithm gets tricky. It states that wherever the fast and slow pointers met, set a pointer there and another at the start of the list. Start moving them step by step. Where they meet is the start of the cycle.
Why does this work?
Assume that length from start of the list to the start of the cycle is X. From the start of the cycle to meeting point is Y and from meeting point to the start ( in forward direction) is Z. Length of cycle C  = Y + Z.
We need to prove that set the pointer at start and another at the collision point, the latter will loop around the circle a few times and then collide with the start of the loop.

or X = aC + Z


the slow pointer will never complete a full loop before the fast pointer catches it. The collision is guaranteed to happen during the slow pointer's first traversal of the loop.
Because every step, the the fast closes 1 space between them and worst case the space is C-1 ( when fast is just one step ahead when slow enters the loop). Fast will close this gap in C-1 seconds and in the same time slow will be 1 step behind completing the loop. Hence if slow cannot complete a circle in worst case, it cannot complete circle in any other case.

So, Distance covered by slow 
```
Dslow = X + Y
```

Fast loops around the circle a zero or more times before travelling Y more steps to meet fast
```
Dfast = X + nC + Y
```

Since fast moves 2x the speed of slow, 
```
2 X Dslow = Dfast
2X + 2Y = X + nC + Y
X + Y = nC
X = nC - Y
X = (n-1)C + (C-Y)
X = (n-1)C + Z
X = kC + Z
```

Distance travelled by fast pointer

They can only meet at the start of the cycle if for some number n X = n(C) + Z. If we can prove this equation, then we have proof that the algorithm works.

| Sliding Window Maximum | [Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/) | Do not pay attention to the difficulty. This is a medium problem at worse - just a very common pattern in queues - BE CAREFUL WHILE POPPING FROM QUEUE COMPARING WITH CURRENT - DO NOT USE <= as this creates complications on repeat elements - we want to main both copies of repeats in the queue - think example - [7,5,7,1,6,0], k = 3|

**Stacks**
- These are used when we want to analyze a linear sequence but lookback closed characters first
- Consider a stack when a solution depends on resolving the most recent state before or after the current state

|---|---:|---|
|Remove All adjacent duplicates | [Remove all adjacent duplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/description/) | Check if stack top is duplicate with current, if yes keep popping. Push to stack if you did not perform any pop |
| Simplify Directory Path | [Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/) | Be careful of the several edge cases here namely: We have to take care not to push empty string or "." or ".." unto stack, then when removing trailing '/' we have to make sure the string isn't simply "/" |

| Min stack | [Min stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/) |  Whenever we want to store two numbers in the same place, we apply some trick. Remember the trick we applied for A[i]=A[A[i]]. Here if x<y, x + x < x+y , 2x-y < x. Therefore if we get a minimum < current minimum, we can push 2*min - cur_min unto stack. Whenever the stack's top is < the minimum, we know the minimum is getting removed. Then top = 2*cur_min - prev_min. prev_min = 2*cur_min - top, thus we can easily get the prev min. Only thing is what we try to push INT_MAX? Can we operate with longs instead then? |
| Redundant Brackets | [Redundant Brackets](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/redundant-braces/) | Generally the way to handle brackets is start computing as soon as you encounter a closed bracket.

#### Block 6 Greedy, Dynamic Programming
**Greedy**
- Remember when given a sequence of numbers or intervals that sorting a certain way could lead to an optimal answer
- If sorting is not an option and we are given a sequence, perhaps we can use a stack or a queue to remove unoptimal elements?
- If you cannot solve the Greedy question outright, try with DP first! Most of the times this works. Then try to optimize the DP question to Greedy
