# ðŸš€ ULTIMATE DSA
Your ultimate DSA interview cheat code â€” a no-fluff vault of the most frequently asked questions.  
If itâ€™s not here, chances are, you wonâ€™t be asked.

A hand-picked compilation of questions from across top platforms â€” complete with clear explanations, multiple solution approaches, and a smart preparation roadmap.  
Direct practice links are included so you can sharpen your skills where it matters most.

### ðŸ—º High-Level Preparation Roadmap
Topics are grouped into **independent blocks**, but the blocks themselves should be tackled **in order** for maximum efficiency:

**Block 1** â€” Math, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues  
**Block 2** â€” Searching, Sorting, Hashing  
**Block 3** â€” Strings  
**Block 4** â€” Trees, Graphs  
**Block 5** â€” Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Design

### âœ… Block-Wise Checklist (with Gist!)
A block-by-block list of problems with:
- **Links** to solve them directly.
- **Gist summaries** for lightning-fast revision â€” perfect for that final 1â€“2 day sprint before an interview.  
Decide whether to code them again based on your confidence and remaining time.

#### Block 1 Math, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues 

**Linked Lists**
 - Rearrangement is the name of the game here. Questions like reverse a linked lists ( constant memory), k-reverse linked lists, merge sort on linked lists - all require a mastery over the concept of rearrangement. I have attached images for Linked lists in particular to help visualize the re-arrangement so that you can memorize the concept instead of the code.
 - I cannot emphasise this enough. ALWAYS CREATE A DUMMY HEAD of the linked lists. Return Dummy head -> next if you have to but it is always easier to create a dummy head ( In the beginning just make this a practise and soon while solving some of the more advanced problems like LRU cache, you will see why I emphasised this)
 - Linked List questions can often benefit from having two pointers move at different speeds ( How about mid-point of a linked list? Cycle Detection?)
 - Linked List cyclicity is the other most important concept - hence I will clearly explain the algorithm and why it works? Learn the why part carefully - good companies with smart people and a good culture will ask this instead of asking fancy super-hard rated problems

_Reversing a Linked Lists_
Assume first node is the dummy head. We are trying to do this visually:

The algorithm roughly looks like:

_Linked List Cyclicity: Algorith and why it works_
The algo maintains two pointers. One moves twice the speed of other - if there is a cycle in the linked list, both will eventually enter the cycle and in the cycle, the faster pointer will catch up to it. If it does, we know for sure that there is a cycle. This is purely logical.
![floyd_cycle_finding](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfc663e3-f843-41c4-8ed9-345755a930cf)

Finding the start of the cycle is where the algorithm gets tricky. It states that wherever the fast and slow pointers met, set a pointer there and another at the start of the list. Start moving them step by step. Where they meet is the start of the cycle.
Why does this work?
Assume that length from start of the list to the start of the cycle is X. From the start of the cycle to meeting point is Y and from meeting point to the start ( in forward direction) is Z. Length of cycle C  = Y + Z.

They can only meet at the start of the cycle if for some number n X = n(C) + Z. If we can prove this equation, then we have proof that the algorithm works.
