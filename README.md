### âœ… Block-Wise Checklist (with Gist!)
A block-by-block list of problems with:
- **Links** to solve them directly.
- **Gist summaries** for lightning-fast revision â€” perfect for that final 1â€“2 day sprint before an interview.  
Decide whether to code them again based on your confidence and remaining time.

#### Block 1 Math, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues 

**Linked Lists**
 - Rearrangement is the name of the game here. Questions like reverse a linked lists ( constant memory), k-reverse linked lists, merge sort on linked lists - all require a mastery over the concept of rearrangement. I have attached images for Linked lists in particular to help visualize the re-arrangement so that you can memorize the concept instead of the code.
 - I cannot emphasise this enough. ALWAYS CREATE A DUMMY HEAD of the linked lists. Return Dummy head -> next if you have to but it is always easier to create a dummy head ( In the beginning just make this a practise and soon while solving some of the more advanced problems like LRU cache, you will see why I emphasised this)
 - Linked List questions can often benefit from having two pointers move at different speeds ( How about mid-point of a linked list? Cycle Detection?)
 - Linked List cyclicity is the other most important concept - hence I will clearly explain the algorithm and why it works? Learn the why part carefully - good companies with smart people and a good culture will ask this instead of asking fancy super-hard rated problems
 - The whole purpose of Linked lists is dynamic allocation to save memory so always practice every question in an O(1) space way - even if it means sacrificing Performance ( within reason)

_Reversing a Linked List: TITH Algorithm_
Assume first node is the dummy head. We are trying to do this visually:
<img width="2198" height="1256" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c52ac58-6485-4286-a24e-bd8f3537aa95" />
The algorithm roughly looks like:

After you understand why this works - for speed, you can memorize this algorithm

```
        ListNode* itr = dummyHead->next;
        ListNode* temp = NULL;
        while(itr && itr->next){
            temp = itr->next; // T
            itr->next = temp->next; // I
            temp->next = dummyHead->next; // T
            dummyHead->next = temp; // H
        }

        return dummyHead->next;
```
We can reverse the same algorithm to reverse a sublist! just perform the step in the loop n = size of sublist times!

_Linked List Cyclicity: Algorith and why it works_
The algo maintains two pointers. One moves twice the speed of other - if there is a cycle in the linked list, both will eventually enter the cycle and in the cycle, the faster pointer will catch up to it. If it does, we know for sure that there is a cycle. This is purely logical.

![floyd_cycle_finding](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfc663e3-f843-41c4-8ed9-345755a930cf)

Finding the start of the cycle is where the algorithm gets tricky. It states that wherever the fast and slow pointers met, set a pointer there and another at the start of the list. Start moving them step by step. Where they meet is the start of the cycle.
Why does this work?
Assume that length from start of the list to the start of the cycle is X. From the start of the cycle to meeting point is Y and from meeting point to the start ( in forward direction) is Z. Length of cycle C  = Y + Z.
We need to prove that set the pointer at start and another at the collision point, the latter will loop around the circle a few times and then collide with the start of the loop.

or X = aC + Z


the slow pointer will never complete a full loop before the fast pointer catches it. The collision is guaranteed to happen during the slow pointer's first traversal of the loop.
Because every step, the the fast closes 1 space between them and worst case the space is C-1 ( when fast is just one step ahead when slow enters the loop). Fast will close this gap in C-1 seconds and in the same time slow will be 1 step behind completing the loop. Hence if slow cannot complete a circle in worst case, it cannot complete circle in any other case.

So, Distance covered by slow 
```
Dslow = X + Y
```

Fast loops around the circle a zero or more times before travelling Y more steps to meet fast
```
Dfast = X + nC + Y
```

Since fast moves 2x the speed of slow, 
```
2 X Dslow = Dfast
2X + 2Y = X + nC + Y
X + Y = nC
X = nC - Y
X = (n-1)C + (C-Y)
X = (n-1)C + Z
X = kC + Z
```

Distance travelled by fast pointer

They can only meet at the start of the cycle if for some number n X = n(C) + Z. If we can prove this equation, then we have proof that the algorithm works.

#### Block 2 - Strings, Hashing, Searching, Sorting

| Subarray sum equals k| [Subarray sum equals k](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/) | We know given a array with prefix sums, sum of subarray between i..j = prefix[j] - prefix[i-1]. So if prefix[j] - prefix[i-1] ==k for some i,j where i<j then prefix[i-1] = prefix[j] -k. Therefore if we track prefix sum of array and find if prefix_sum -k can also be found previously as prefix sum in any point in the array then we can increment answer by the number of times we found that sum.

| Find the longest subarray with sum 0 | [Longest with sum 0 ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-subarray-with-0-sum/1)| Same principles as above but maybe only store the index instead of count this time?

**String**
- There is only one pattern of "string" problems and that is pattern-matching in linear time. Any other problem is an array problem.
- For pattern matching, there are only two algorithms both are unintuitive and require memorization with the latter requiring knowledge on rolling hashes ( and being slightly more intuitive) - 1) Z-Algorithm 2) Rabin Karp Algorithm. Yes, I know there are other algorithms like KMP but I'm sorry if I'm learning an algorithm, it better be the shorter one like Z.
- The one advantage that rolling hashes offer is less space utilization
- Yet another non-sensical algorithm called Manacher's algorithm exists. It is for a very very specific use case of finding palindromes in the middle of a string. No need to learn this. For most cases using Rabin Karp siffuces ( see Shortest Palindrom below)

_Explanation of Rabin Karp Algorithm_

Rabinâ€“Karp uses **rolling hashes** for efficient substring search.
- **Hash of substring** \([l,r]\):  
  \[
  H[l,r] = \sum_{i=l}^{r} s[i]\cdot p^i
  \]  
  where \(p\) is a prime base (e.g., 23).

- _Properties_:  
  \[
  H[l,r] = H[l,r-1] + H[r,r], \quad H[l,r] = H[l-1,r]-H[l-1,l-1]
  \]  

- **Sliding the window** (shift by 1):  
  \[
  H_{new} = H_{prev}\cdot p
  \]

- **Modular arithmetic**: Use a large prime modulus (e.g., \(10^9+7\)) to prevent overflow.

At iteration \(i\) (window ending at \(i\), pattern length \(M\)):

\[
H_r = (H_r - s[i-M]\cdot p^{i-M} + MOD)\bmod MOD
\]  
(remove char leaving window)

\[
H_r = (H_r + s[i]\cdot p^i)\bmod MOD
\]  
(add new char entering window)

\[
H_p = (H_p\cdot p)\bmod MOD
\]  
(update pattern hash)

Finally, compare **\(H_r\)** and **\(H_p\)**.

| String Pattern matching | [Find first occurence of string](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/description/) | Standard pattern matching algorithm - use any of Rabin Karp or Z Algorithm|
| Shortest Palindrome | [Shortest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/description/) | Use rolling hashes or pattern matching algorithms to do this. Main a running forward and reverse hash, keep updating limit whenever they are equal. Your answer is reverse(substr(lim,end)) + ans|

**Sorting**
- Sometimes order the elements is the clear way to go. Whenever you observe a Linear Sequence, one of the options when you think algorithmically is 'Can I do this efficiently if the linear sequence was sorted?'
- Know the following algorithms really well: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Quick Select ( For tutorials on the same - Refer Stanford DSA videos)
- Merge Sort in particular due to it's divide and conquer nature offers other advanced applications like counting inversions in an Array! The intuition here is if I had the array in current order as well as sorted order and I could compare both, then would my solution become simpler?
- Do not bother with in-place merge sort, it is slower.
- Unless asked to implement sort, just use your in-built sorting algorithm and obviously know what it does underneath. For instance std::sort is introsort, a hybrid of quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort. Should be ideally nLogn
- Pivot Randomization is very important in Quicksort/Quickselect algorithms. Some test cases are designed to fail on selecting the first or last element all the time. To get a random number use the below piece of code
```
srand((unsigned int)time(0)) // Seed random with current time
int pivot = rand()%(y-x+1) + x
```
- Also in merge sort/quick-sort, never use >= or <= but always use strict > or < as it can have disastrous results ( Take quick select over [99,99] for instance, you get stuck in a loop )
- Know how to sort an array of custom objects or custom sorting logic over primitives in your language of choice

If you then think about it, isn't this always the second largest element ( not equal to the largest )? Now it just about handling the edge case|
|Largest Number |[Largest Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/description/) | Custom Sorting: string(n1)+string(n2)>string(n2)+string(n1). Just be sure to handle the edge case where every element is 0.|
|Inversion Count | [Count Inversions](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-merge-sort/problem) | Merge Sort with extra computation. When we merge the sorted halves if i is in first half and j is in second half and  A[i]>A[j] then inversions = inversions + (m-i+1). An important point to consider is why are we incrementing inversion count by (m-i+1) and not (j-m) ? Think via example! Consider two sorted arrays 3,5,7 | 1,4,8 . If we consider only j-m then we would be counting only 1 for when we are at the first element of both arrays which is incorrect since all elements of left are greater than the first element, we should be counting 3! | 
| K closest points to origin | [K closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/) | Custom sorting - can be done more efficiently with a heap| 
| Reverse Pairs | [Reverse Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-pairs/) |  Like Count inversions except we need to do two loops over the sorted half. Once will count the reverse pairs and other will actually merge the sorted arrays |
| Sum of max or number of such sequences difference accross all subsequences | [Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subsequences-that-satisfy-the-given-sum-condition/description/) | |
| Maximum Unsorted Subarray | [Maximum Unsorted Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-unsorted-continuous-subarray/description/) | This looks simple but is deceptive. It is not simply about find the first and last unsorted element. For instance consider 4,13,15,17,13,17. Trivial algos would return incorrect solution here. Find the rightmost element by tracking max in the forward loop and then leftmost element by tracking min in a reverse loop.|

#### Block 3 - Heaps
- To Declare a min Heap of integers
```
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minQ
```
- To Declare a heap on a custom class, we need a Compare class with a public implementation of the operator() method. Note that the condition must be reverse of what you would provide while custom sorting.
For instance the below piece of code can be used to declare a max heap of vector<int> where each vector is a point on x-y plane and we consider distance of the point from origin as the criteria for max heap
```
long dist(const vector<int> &v){
    return v[0]*v[0] + v[1]*v[1];
}

class Compare {
public:
    bool operator()(vector<int>&v1, vector<int>&v2){
        return dist(v1) < dist(v2);
    }
};

priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, Compare> maxQ;
```

#### Block 6 Greedy, Dynamic Programming
**Greedy**
- Remember when given a sequence of numbers or intervals that sorting a certain way could lead to an optimal answer
- If sorting is not an option and we are given a sequence, perhaps we can use a stack or a queue to remove unoptimal elements?
- If you cannot solve the Greedy question outright, try with DP first! Most of the times this works. Then try to optimize the DP question to Greedy

#### Block 7 Hard Problems

| Problem Name | Link | Gist |
|---|---:|---|
| Median of 2 sorted arrays | [Median of two sorted arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/) | Number of elements in the left-half ( including median) of a sorted array is (N+1)/2. Additionally all the elements in the left half are <= right half. Thus we can just binary search over the number of elements to include from first array, let's say m1. Then the number of elements to include from the other array is m2  = (N+1)/2 - m1. Now we must compare the boundaries i.e take the element on the boundries ( m1-1 and m2-1) is a and b. The elements just beyond the boundary ( m1 and m2) is c and d. Then a<=d and b<=c, If yes, we can find our median ( odd = max(a,b), even = (max(a,b) + min(c,d))/2 |
