# ðŸš€ ULTIMATE DSA
Your ultimate DSA interview cheat code â€” a no-fluff vault of the most frequently asked questions.  
If itâ€™s not here, chances are, you wonâ€™t be asked.

A hand-picked compilation of questions from across top platforms â€” complete with clear explanations, multiple solution approaches, and a smart preparation roadmap.  
Direct practice links are included so you can sharpen your skills where it matters most.

### ðŸ—º High-Level Preparation Roadmap
Topics are grouped into **independent blocks**, but the blocks themselves should be tackled **in order** for maximum efficiency:

**Block 1** â€” Math, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues  
**Block 2** â€” Searching, Sorting, Hashing  
**Block 3** â€” Strings  
**Block 4** â€” Trees, Graphs  
**Block 5** â€” Greedy, Dynamic Programming

### âœ… Block-Wise Checklist (with Gist!)
A block-by-block list of problems with:
- **Links** to solve them directly.
- **Gist summaries** for lightning-fast revision â€” perfect for that final 1â€“2 day sprint before an interview.  
Decide whether to code them again based on your confidence and remaining time.

#### Block 5 Greedy, Dynamic Programming
**Greedy**

| Problem Name | Link | Gist |
|---|---:|---|
| Jump Game | [Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/) | Track the furthest reachable index in linear time. |
| Gas Station | [Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/) | If total gas â‰¥ total cost a solution exists; track running surplus to find the start. |
| Jump Game II | [Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/) | Think like BFS â€” greedy expansion by range to minimize jumps. |
| Remove Duplicate Letters | [Remove Duplicate Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/) | Use a stack to maintain lexicographically smallest result while ensuring required counts remain. |
| Wiggle Subsequence | [Wiggle Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/) | Can be solved greedily (track up/down slopes) or with DP. |
| Remove K Digits | [Remove K Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/) | Use a monotonic stack to build the smallest possible number after removals. |
| Queue Reconstruction by Height | [Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/) | Sort by height desc and insert each person at their k-index. |
| Non-overlapping Intervals | [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/) | Sort by end time and greedily choose intervals that finish earliest. |
| Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons | [Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/) | Interval greedy: sort by end coordinate and pick minimally overlapping groups. |
| Task Scheduler | [Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/) | Model as filling slots determined by most frequent task; use math or heap to compute idle slots. |
| Maximum Length of Pair Chain | [Maximum Length of Pair Chain](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/) | Sort by end and greedily pick non-overlapping pairs (earliest finish first). |
| Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences | [Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences/) | Use frequency and "tails" map to extend or start subsequences. |
| Maximum Swap | [Maximum Swap](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-swap/) | Find the rightmost occurrence of the largest digit to swap with the leftmost smaller digit. |
| Monotone Increasing Digits | [Monotone Increasing Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/monotone-increasing-digits/) | Greedily scan and decrement when digits decrease, then set following digits to 9. |
| Partition Labels | [Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/) | Track last occurrences; cut a partition when current index reaches the furthest last index of chars seen. |
| Reorganize String | [Reorganize String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/) | Greedy via max-heap: always place the two most frequent remaining chars to avoid repeats. |
| Increasing Triplet Subsequence | [Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/) | Track two smallest values; if a third larger value appears, you have a triplet. |
| Max Increase to Keep City Skyline | [Max Increase to Keep City Skyline](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-increase-to-keep-city-skyline/) | Per-cell increase limited by min(maxRow, maxCol); sum the differences. |
| Score After Flipping Matrix | [Score After Flipping Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/) | Greedy flips rows/columns to maximize interpreted binary row values. |
| Hand of Straights | [Hand of Straights](https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/) | Use sorted keys + frequency to form consecutive groups of size W. |
| Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid | [Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/) | Use a counter or stack to count unmatched parentheses. |
| Advantage Shuffle | [Advantage Shuffle](https://leetcode.com/problems/advantage-shuffle/) | Greedy: match smallest elements that can beat opponentâ€™s element; otherwise sacrifice smallest. |
| Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique | [Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-increment-to-make-array-unique/) | Sort and increment duplicates greedily (or use counting) to enforce uniqueness. |
